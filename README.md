# Go Interfaces

This is an effort to understand the function and use of Go Interfaces

** Go interfaces encourages one to be lazy, and this is a good thing. Instead of writing types to fulfil interfaces, write interfaces to fulfil usage requirements. **

## The more idiomatic way would be this:

1. Define the types
2. Define the interface at point of use.
